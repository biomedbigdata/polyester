\title{Internal sequencing function}
\usage{
sgseq(
  readmat,
  transcripts,
  paired,
  outdir,
  extras,
  reportCoverage = FALSE,
  ncores = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{readmat}{a N by M matrix describing the full counts for the
experiment; each row is an experiment and each column is a sample in the
experiment.}

\item{transcripts}{a \code{DNAStringSet} object containing the transcripts
from which reads are simulated}

\item{paired}{a boolean determining whether or not to simulated paired-end
or single-end reads}

\item{outdir}{the output directory where the simulated reads will be written}

\item{extras}{a list of extra options, generated internally by
\code{simulate_experiment}, \code{simulate_experiment_countmat}, or
\code{simulate_experiment_empirical}}

\item{reportCoverage}{whether to write out coverage information to
\code{sample_coverages.rda} file in the \code{outdir}.
defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{ncores}{the number of cores to be utilized for parallel generation
of simulated reads. Note that if more than one core is specified,
the code will parallelize by replicate, so if num_reps == 1, this
will not be utilized.}
}
\value{
no return value. This function is called for its side effect of
  generating simulated reads and writing them to file.
}
\description{
This internal function actually does the sequencing in the following steps:
generate the fragments, get the reads from the fragments, add any errors,
and then write the reads. It does this in 1 million reads chunks to
balance speed and memory usage. This is not intended to be called directly;
instead it is meant to be called via \code{\link{simulate_experiment}},
\code{\link{simulate_experiment_countmat}}, or \code{\link{simulate_experiment_empirical}}.
